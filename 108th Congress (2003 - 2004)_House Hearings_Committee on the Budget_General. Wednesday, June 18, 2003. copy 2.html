<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget Committee to order. Today the Budget Committee will hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the General Accounting Office on its efforts to identify<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, fraud and abuse in the Federal Government. Our witness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is the Honorable David M. Walker, the Comptroller General of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the U.S. General Accounting Office or, as some refer to it,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">``the Government Accountability Office.'' We are trying to get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that name changed for you, General. We will see how we do.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>General Walker, I want to thank you for being here and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">welcome you back to the committee. You have been here many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">times and we appreciate the work that you and the GAO does on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">our behalf.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I have some slides I would like to go through. The first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">slide, as you can see from this chart, since 1995, overall<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government spending has increased nearly 41 percent, or at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about 4.4 percent a year. This is total government spending.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The second chart shows that non-Social Security mandatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs, in particular, have grown at about 37.4 percent since<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">1995, about 4 percent each year. If you look at individual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget categories, overall education spending has grown at 82<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent. Veterans mandatory spending has grown at 49 percent.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare mandatory spending has grown at 55 percent. Medicaid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">has grown at 77 percent.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Now with the economic boom and the budget surpluses of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">late 1990s, Congress spent very generously and government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs grew by leaps and bounds. But while these important<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs expanded, we did not ask that Congress expand our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">oversight responsibilities at the same rate that the government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was increasing these programs. As a result, we now have a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government that spends at about $69,000 per second; more,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">certainly, than the average family makes, in many instances, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a year. Let me repeat that, the Federal Government now spends<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">$69,000 per second. And if you look at the chart, you will see<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that this kind of pace has been going on when it comes to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending increases for quite some time. As it expands out,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">obviously, we are going to have a problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We have massive government agencies with massive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">responsibilities and obligations. As everybody in this room and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">everybody in America knows, it is unconscionable, but it has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many different varying amounts of bureaucratic waste, fraud and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">abuse within its agencies. Certainly, this is not a new<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem, but the question is why is it allowed to continue?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As we know from GAO reports--and there are hundreds and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thousands of them, and I know that General Walker will discuss<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many of them today--many government agencies cannot even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">account for much of their own budgets. In many cases, agencies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are punished if they don't spend the entire budget or if they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">uncover waste or inefficiencies. The more they waste, the more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they get. There is absolutely no incentive to find savings. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is wrong and it needs to change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Everyone has heard the, ``if you don't use it, you will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lose it'' adage, that has been around for quite sometime. There<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is no family business in America that would operate that way,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">certainly no family operates that way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We are going to focus on the mandatory or entitlement<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending side of this today for many reasons. I want to show<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you the spending breakdown for the Federal budget. As you can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">see from this chart, 55 percent of overall spending is what we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">call mandatory. Another way to say that is it is automatic. It<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">continues every year, not subject to appropriations, there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no built in process of review, it is automatic. It just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">continues typically with large annual increases in the budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Certainly the Appropriations Committee has got to do their job.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Appropriations have increased at astronomical rates as well on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the discretionary side. But to just look at the discretionary<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">side would miss over half of the budget responsibility. And as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we know from General Walker, GAO reports, IG reports and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">elsewhere, billions of these dollars are wasted every year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So we are holding the hearing today as another step in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">process that we started back in March, when we passed the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget, that required every authorizing committee in both the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">House and Senate to identify means of eliminating waste, fraud<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and abuse within their jurisdiction by September 2 of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">year. The goal we set for each committee was to find one penny<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the dollar in savings for each dollar that they spend. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understand that they might find a little less, some might find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even a little more, but this is a goal and I think a worthwhile<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">starting point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And last month, this committee joined the House Republican<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">leadership and committee chairmen in publicly announcing our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">determination to change this tolerance, and we did so as a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">leadership and committee chairs for a reason. Oftentimes in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">past, this has been an individual effort or project; one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">individual Member or group of Members. I think it is different<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when committee chairs and leadership join in this process. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stand committed and ready to do the hard work to ensure that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government spends taxpayers' dollars more responsibly. I want<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to applaud the committees who have already begun this effort,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">including the House Veterans' Affairs, and Government Reform<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">committees; both the Commerce and Ways and Means committees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have waste, fraud and abuse hearings scheduled, and I believe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it is a good start.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Just last night, the Ways and Means Committee in a somewhat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">unprecedented way, included a title within the Medicare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">modernization bill that passed last night at 11:30. It was a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, fraud and abuse title. It got very little fanfare, no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discussion and actually, interestingly enough, no complaints in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part because this is a bipartisan approach. As a result of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ways and Means Medicare mark, $33 billion will be eliminated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the Medicare program that has been wasted or fraudulently<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">applied.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So today we continue the process to help in this effort and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we are going to hear from the General Accounting Office. We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also going to take a different new step. We have all heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stories of government waste in education, agriculture,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicaid, Medicare. My own constituents have told me many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stories, and yours as well, and we want to hear these stories.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">So today we are going to invite the American public to be part<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of this process. We are unveiling a link at our Web site,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">www.budget.house.gov., which will provide the public an outlet<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to report their observations of government waste.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I don't want anyone to think that, just because we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">running billion dollar deficits, or that billion dollars is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what we talk about often in Washington, that if you have a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">story that involves only $100, or $1,000, that isn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">worthwhile. We want to hear it all, because all of this money<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">adds up; the nickels and dimes become dollars very quickly. At<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the end of the day, we may find only $10 million or $10<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion, but every dollar that we find that is better spent is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dollars that is not wasted, that is hard earned by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxpayers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And let me be clear, this is not a Republican or Democrat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effort. This can and should be a bipartisan effort. This<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">affects us all and all of our constituents can be part of this.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We can enter into a blame game. The Democrats have evidence and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">charts showing how this is all a Republican plot and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Republicans have charts that can show why this is all because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the Democrats. And we can continue to go through historical<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">efforts to show how the other party is totally to blame. That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would be interesting but it would be a waste of time. And just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like we should not waste money, we really don't need to waste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">time either. We can disagree on policy and how best to get the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">economy going, but we really don't need to disagree on whether<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or not waste within the Federal Government is something that we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can work together to eliminate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So I appreciate the work that Mr. Walker and his team<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">continue to do in this effort. We need to pay attention to what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the GAO says when their little blue books come out. We need to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do more than just allow them to sit on a shelf and collect<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dust, and we will do that as part of this process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Thank you. I want to turn to Mr. Spratt for any comments he<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would like to make.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, General Walker and Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McIntyre. We very much appreciate not only your coming but the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">efforts you have put into the preparation of your testimony,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">because we too are interested in eliminating waste, fraud and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">abuse from government spending. In fact, the Clinton<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">administration opened its administration with the National<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Performance Review making government smarter and cost less. By<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his calculation $100 billion was saved. That may be hype but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nevertheless significant savings were ferreted out and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">implemented. We as Democrats have passed in the past and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Democratic Presidents have signed into law bipartisan measures<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to reform government, beginning going back to acts like the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Inspector General Act of 1978, which has surely paid dividends<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and does every day, and the Government Performance and Results<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Act of 1993.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We have reservations about a formalistic approach that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gives percentage numbers to different committees of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jurisdiction. In response to the chairman's charts, we would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like to make it clear that one of the reasons those mandatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">costs are going up is that a substantial component consists of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the medical health care entitlements. And as the population<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gets older, the cost of health care goes up. We all experience<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that in our own individual lives. We are experiencing that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">collectively in our society today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The fact of the matter is 77 million baby boomers are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">marching toward their retirement as we meet today. They begin<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">retiring in the year 2008 and start drawing Medicare in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">year 2011, and there is nothing we can do to make that tide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recede. They are born and they are going to demand their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">benefits. When they do, we will eventually double the number of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beneficiaries on Social Security and Medicare, and that is why<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we are concerned about what you are doing to the revenue base<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the Federal Government. We think you are diminishing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">revenue base to the point where it cannot sustain the Medicare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program or the Social Security program or these programs that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the population of this country come to depend upon and care<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">deeply about.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We think as you drain away government revenues, you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also driving the deficit higher and higher. It is likely to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over $400 billion this year unless we take drastic steps to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reverse the course that we are now on, likely to be over $400<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion over the next 10 years. That means $4 trillion in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">additional debt. I don't know if we have the chart available,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but there is something we began to call the debt tax--not the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">death tax--that is today--the debt tax, because as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accumulate this debt you can see what happens to debt service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We have indeed enjoyed the savings over the last 4 years.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">From 1997-2000, we paid off $400 billion of government debt. As<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a result of that and a result of the fact that the government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for 8 consecutive years--the deficit was declining. We were not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">crowding out private borrowers. Interest rates went down. Debt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">service has dropped from over $250 billion to about $170<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion this year. That is a $70 [billion] to $80 billion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dividend we have been able to use for other purposes or at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">least charge up to savings in the Federal Government. That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">won't last long, not at the rate we are accumulating debt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We are also concerned, let me say, about the scope of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inquiry. First of all, we are looking at the spending side of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the ledger today. We should look at the tax side, too. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">haven't had a good cleaning out of the closet, a good scrub<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down of the tax code since 1986. And as a result, it is full of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accretions, of special interest provisions, targeted provisions<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that are really an embarrassment to the point they have reached<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We have a witness today, Mr. McIntyre, from Citizens for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tax Justice, who will direct our focus on the tax code because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we think there is plenty of tax expenditures that ought to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">examined and reconsidered. Under expatriation provisions now,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which American corporations are moving to Bermuda, buying a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">telephone and setting up a mailbox and claiming they are now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">domesticated in Bermuda. We are allowing something outrageous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">like that to happen and doing nothing about it. That too should<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be a topic of our concern.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We are very concerned--this is a worthwhile exercise and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">commend the chairman for undertaking it, but I hope we don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">treat this as a red herring, to divert our attention from the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">serious problem of accumulating deficits and mounting debt.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Whatever we are able to accomplish through the efforts we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">undertake, there is no way the net outcome of this is going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be the eradication of the debt we are now accumulating. We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to do something else about tax policy and about spending policy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">other than just ferret out waste and abuse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Having expressed all these concerns, let me say that we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stand ready to work with you to define waste, fraud and abuse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and to wipe it out. We welcome you, Mr. Walker, and look<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">welcome Mr. McIntyre from Citizens for Tax Justice and look<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">forward to his testimony.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Chairman, I have a full statement which I will offer<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the record.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Prepared Statement of Hon. John M. Spratt, Jr., a Representative in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">               </span>Congress From the State of South Carolina</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We strongly support efforts to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from government spending. Indeed, the Clinton administration initiated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the National Performance Review, which is supposed to have saved more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than $100 billion. Democratic Congresses have passed and Democratic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">presidents have signed into law bipartisan measures to reform<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government, laws like the Inspector General Act of 1978 and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Government Performance and Results Act of 1993.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We do have reservations, however, about the approach taken in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget resolution conference report. The conference report requires the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">authorizing committees to recommend changes in laws within their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jurisdictions that would eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse, and produce<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget savings totaling $132 billion in outlays over 10 years. Each<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">committee is instructed to find savings of approximately 1 percent of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the net cost of all mandatory spending within its jurisdiction. These<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recommendations can then be used in formulating future budget<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">resolutions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We are concerned that the approach taken in the conference report<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">takes us back to the formula-driven reductions to mandatory spending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">included in your budget resolution and then rejected. These cuts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">started at $470 billion in the chairman's mark, were reduced to $265<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion before floor consideration, and have been reduced again to $132<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion. Not only has the total changed, but committees are required<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now just to recommend these changes, rather than to pass legislation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">implementing them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The arbitrary nature of these cuts is one concern. Their scope is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">another. The fastest rising spike in the budget will soon be interest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the national debt. At the beginning of 2001, the Congressional<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Budget Office projected that the interest costs would fall below zero<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in 2009. Instead, by current staff estimates, net interest costs in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2011 will be $368 billion--$348 billion more than projected by the Bush<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">administration in 2001, and $464 billion more than projected by CBO.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Another concern is that your approach does nothing to address<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, fraud, and abuse in the tax code, a problem that our second<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">witness will address. And by focusing on reductions in mandatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending only, you also neglect waste, fraud, and abuse on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discretionary side of the budget, as in the Department of Defense,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which represents about half of all discretionary funding.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>In any event, the $132 billion in savings that the plan aims to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">generate will not come close to solving our Nation's fiscal problems<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which in large measure have been created by the tax cuts passed in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2001, 2002, and 2003. In January 2001, CBO and OMB projected a $5.6<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trillion surplus. But this March, CBO projected if the President's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget is adopted a total deficit of $1.8 trillion over the period<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2004-13. This deficit total excludes such costs as the occupation and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reconstruction of Iraq, as well as the cost of correcting the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Alternative Minimum Tax. These will make the overall picture even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bleaker. The $132 billion is less than 10 percent of what is needed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">close even a conservative estimate of the budget gap that we face.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Finally, we are concerned that the current approach may, in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">end, threaten vital services to the American people. We recognize that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the instructions to the authorizing committees state that the required<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">levels of savings should be found solely through eliminating waste,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud and abuse. But past efforts to identify waste, fraud, and abuse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">such as President Reagan's Grace Commission have often identified not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">true waste or fraud, but rather policy changes that would, in fact,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reduce benefits received by individuals or businesses. Similarly, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the past when GAO has been asked to identify mandatory budget savings,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some of the options they have identified have included such steps as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">increasing cost-sharing for beneficiaries and revising eligibility<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rules.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We stand ready to work in a bipartisan way to reduce wasteful and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraudulent government spending. But this work must be done carefully<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and responsibly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We welcome the Comptroller General, Mr. Walker, and look forward to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">his testimony, and we welcome Mr. McIntyre, and look forward to his<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">testimony.</span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. I thank the gentleman. I need to report to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr. Spratt and to other members of the committee that if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are worried about accumulating deficits and debt, you may want<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to pay attention to what happened last night on the Ways and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Means Committee. The minority offered an amendment, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">substitute amendment drug plan. And if you remember, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">minority budget that Mr. Spratt wrote accommodated a $528<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion drug plan, which was a little more than, of course, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">majority plan that passed, which was 400 billion. The Blue Dog<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Coalition offered a $400 billion drug plan. But last night the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">minority offered a $1 trillion drug plan.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So don't worry about the fact that it busted our budget, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">busted both of your budgets put together. So if you are worried<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about deficits and debt, as I said, we can talk about blaming,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we can talk about who is at fault, that is fine, we can do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that, and we will get probably nowhere. Today I think we can,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in a bipartisan spirit, not as a red herring, even if it is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dollar--may be a red herring to some, but it shouldn't be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wasted. We are going to hear about some egregious waste that,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no, totally won't eliminate the national debt, but I do think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that if we don't start working on this together, there won't be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">much that we will be able to do together in a bipartisan way.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So I am worried about the deficit and debt as well, but I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">think people have got to start concerning themselves with what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they are doing. And if you bust your own budget, not our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget, forget our budget, I know you didn't vote for ours. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't want ours and that is fine, but I think it would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hypocritical to suggest that you shouldn't at least stick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">within the budget that you wrote, which unfortunately the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">majority of Democrats last night on the committee did not do.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And at some point in time, I think that is what is going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">come back to haunt us in the long-term. Our tax cuts fit within<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a budget. You didn't like it, but you proposed tax cuts in your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We can keep going on this all day, but I am willing to at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">least move on and talk about waste, fraud and abuse today. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if you want to keep talking about national debt tax and all of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this, I am going to unleash all of us and we can all have a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">great debate today about who is at fault and who historically--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and we can go back to Reagan, Carter, Clinton and everybody<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">else. So I would rather stick to waste, fraud and abuse, hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the witness and start talking about how we are going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eliminate it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Let me respond, Mr. Chairman. We proposed $528<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion. And further, a provision out of your budget resolution<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dealing with transportation; namely, the idea that if more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">revenues are generated they can be devoted to that particular<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program area than more user fees generated under the highway<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program and they are paid into the Highway Trust Fund, and your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget resolution allowed an increase. So we stipulated if the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Ways and Means Committee came up with up to $200 billion of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">additional tax measures, identified to the Medicare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prescription drug proposal, that could be added to the $528<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion. The net cost of the budget would still have been $528<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion. We did it frankly because we didn't think you could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">offer anything that was worthy of a name in the way of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prescription drug coverage for less than that. And as you look<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at the package that is coming down the pike now, coming out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your committee last night, it appears to me that what you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proposing is that beneficiaries pay $4,000 of their own money<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in premiums, copayments, deductibles and a gap for the first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">$5,000 of coverage. So I think what is coming down validates<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">our concern that if you are going to be for prescription drug<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">coverage, you have to step up to the plate and pay the price.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Let us not forget you have got on the floor today a total<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">repeal of the estate tax. In the second 10 years after the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">repeal is fully phased in, by our calculation, that will mean a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reduction in Federal revenues of $820 billion. That will pretty<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">well pay the cost of prescription drug coverage under even the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proposal made last night.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Well, let us see, 1 trillion minus 528<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">plus 200 is 728. You are still missing $300 billion. Again, if<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we want to keep having this debate, you are adding $300 billion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>It is important to note that if you look at the composition<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of Federal spending for fiscal 2003, including the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">supplemental, only 39 percent of the total Federal budget is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">represented by discretionary spending. By that, I mean 39<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent is represented by what you, as members, can vote on and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have some control over, through the regular appropriations<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">process; 7 percent is represented by interest on the Federal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debt, which is clearly mandatory in anybody's term and 54<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent is represented by other mandatory programs. So in total<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">61 percent--and if you excluded the supplemental, 64 percent--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would be mandatory.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Now how does that compare, because everything has to be put<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in context. In 1963, when John F. Kennedy was President,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">roughly two-thirds of all Federal spending was discretionary.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It has now flipped. Roughly two-thirds of all Federal spending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is now mandatory and the trend is continuing. And so mandatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs must be part of any examination, although it is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>In GAO's view there are three levels that Congress is going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to have to ultimately deal with in order to address our large<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and growing fiscal gap. At the first level, which is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">subject of this hearing, is addressing vulnerabilities to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. We should have zero<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tolerance for fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement, but in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">largest, most complex, the most diverse, and arguably the most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">important entity on the face of the Earth--the U.S.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Government--it will never be zero. Nevertheless, we should have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">zero tolerance and do whatever we can to absolutely minimize<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">everything that we can do, which we should and we must, we also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">need to move to the next level, improving the economy,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">efficiency and effectiveness of Federal programs and that won't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be enough. We also have to look at reassessing what the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government does, how the government does business and in some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cases who does the government's business in the 21st century.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because what we now have is a building of the base over decades<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and we are going to have to start looking at the base. And I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">testimony, I give specific examples based upon GAO's work in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, abuse and mismanagement. There is real money involved.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We need to take various steps, but they in and of themselves,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are not going to be enough to come close to solving our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This represents a summary of GAO's high risk list, which is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not just dealing with fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be dealt with by the executive branch but also the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The next category is improving economy, efficiency and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effectiveness, and in my testimony I note there are at least<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">four dimensions to this. There is better targeting of existing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs, whether they be grant programs, flood insurance, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Social Security pension offset. There is consolidation of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">certain programs where we have too many players on the field.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">By definition that means you are going to have economy,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">efficiency and effectiveness problems such as food safety,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">homeland security grants, and rural housing assistance. We can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also look at what we can do to achieve better cost recovery,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">real full absorption costing in areas like public power, child<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">support enforcement. We also need to look at areas of cross-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cutting or horizontal Federal activities where there is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tremendous opportunity for savings such as Federal real<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">technology age that we need to fundamentally review and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reassess because not only can we save money through not having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And then last but certainly not least with regard to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">three major categories, a fundamental reassessment of what does<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">choices on the proper role of government. Just 2 weeks ago when<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the long-range problem, and nobody raised their hand--nobody.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tough choices will be required. We need to start with fraud,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">efficiency and effectiveness. And we ultimately have to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reassess what is the proper role of government.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Next, please.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This is an example of the different tools that government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">has to achieve policy. The government has tax incentives. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">need to be reexamined, too. There are a lot of tax incentives<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that have been in the base that may or may not make sense and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">may not be affordable or sustainable going forward. There are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending, mandatory spending, direct loans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This is an example of the education and labor budget.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Namely, of all the different tools the government has in order<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to try to achieve a desired policy objective. I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">respectfully suggest that many of those tools haven't been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Last but certainly not least, health care. I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">variety of issues. If you look at health care in fiscal 2000--</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mandatory outlays, 8 percent discretionary, 20 percent tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">benefits for those that deserve them and avoid abuse of taxpayer funds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by preventing such diversions. Beyond preventing obvious abuse,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government also has an obligation to modernize its priorities,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">today's changing world. More broadly, the Federal Government must<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discretionary, and tax incentives--in the context of the 21st century.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Periodic reexamination and revaluation of government activities has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">never been more important than it is today. Our Nation faces long-term<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fiscal challenges. Increased pressure also comes from world events:<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Federal budget--and even less if you look only at programmatic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending.\1\</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>In addition, we can't forget about tax incentives. I make this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">point to reinforce the fact that efforts to assure prudent use of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mismanagement, and efforts to improve economy, efficiency and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effectiveness cannot focus solely on discretionary appropriations but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">must also encompass mandatory programs and tax policy, including tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">incentives.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Direct, or mandatory, spending programs are by definition assumed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the baseline and not automatically subject to annual congressional<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">review as are appropriated discretionary programs. Nonetheless, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">periodic reassessment of these programs, as well as tax incentives, is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">critical to achieving fiscal discipline in the budget as a whole.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Moreover, such a review can help ascertain whether these programs are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">protected from the risk of fraud, waste and abuse and are designed to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">effectiveness of programs within their jurisdiction.'' My testimony<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">draws in part on some of the items that will be included in that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">report.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Today I want to talk about program reviews, oversight, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stewardship of taxpayer funds on several levels:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>First, it is important to deal with areas vulnerable to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. Payments to ineligibles drain<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">resources that could otherwise go to the intended beneficiaries of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program. Everyone should be concerned about the diversion of resources<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and subsequent undermining of program integrity.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Second, and more broadly, policymakers and managers need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to look at ways to improve the economy, efficiency and effectiveness of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal programs and specific tax expenditures. Even where we agree on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the goals of programs, numerous opportunities exist to streamline,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">target and consolidate to improve their delivery. This means looking at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program consolidation, at overlap and at fragmentation. For example, it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">means tackling excess Federal real property--whether at home or abroad.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">It means improved targeting in both spending programs and tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">incentives--in some cases, spreading limited funds over a wide<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">population or beneficiary group may not be the best approach.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Finally, a fundamental reassessment of government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs, policies, and activities can help weed out programs that are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">outdated ineffective unsustainable, or simply a lower priority than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they used to be. In most Federal mission areas--from low-income housing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to food safety to higher education assistance--national goals are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">achieved through the use of a variety of tools and, increasingly,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through the participation of many organizations, such as State and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">local governments and international organizations, that are beyond the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">direct control of the Federal Government. Government cannot accept as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">``givens'' all of its existing major programs, policies, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations. A fundamental review of what the Federal Government does,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">how it does it, and in some cases, who does the government's business<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will be required, particularly given the demographic tidal wave that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">starting to show on our fiscal horizon.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>addressing vulnerabilities to fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Programs and functions central to national goals and objectives<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have been hampered by daunting financial and program management<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problems, exposing these activities to fraud, waste and abuse. These<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">weaknesses have real consequences with large stakes that are important<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and visible to many Americans. Some of the problems involve the waste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of scarce Federal resources. Other problems compromise the ability of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Federal Government to deliver critically needed services, such as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ensuring airline safety and efficiently collecting taxes. Still others<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">may undermine government's ability to safeguard critical assets from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">theft and misuse.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>In 1990, GAO began a program to report on government operations we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chronic, systemic performance and management shortfalls threatening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxpayer dollars and the integrity of government operations. Over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">years GAO has made many recommendations to improve these high-risk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operations. We discovered that the label often inspired corrective<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">action--indeed 13 areas have come off the list since its inception. For<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">each of these areas, we focus on (1) why the area is high-risk; (2) the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">actions that have been taken and that are under way to address the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and oversight, such as that exemplified by this hearing today are of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">crucial importance. The administration has looked to our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Clearly progress has been made in addressing most of the areas on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">our current high risk list, both through executive actions and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">congressional initiatives. However, many of these problems and risks<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are chronic and long standing in nature and their ultimate solution<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will require persistent and dedicated efforts on many fronts by many<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">actors. Some will require changes in laws to simplify or change rules<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">against fraud and other forms of noncompliance associated with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">credit. Further, the complexity of the EIC may contribute to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">noncompliance. The EIC is among the more complex provisions of the tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">addition, unlike other income transfer programs, the EIC relies more on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their relationship to the qualifying child. Because planning and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">success will depend on careful planning and close management attention.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Congress has already focused oversight attention on the EIC<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. I thank you, General Walker, for your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">testimony. Would you give us some examples that you find most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">egregious within this category? You have provided us with a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">long list of examples, but I was hoping that you would pull out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a few that you thought were, in your opinion, from your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">experience, the most egregious examples of waste, fraud, abuse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and mismanagement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Let me give you some examples. Whether or not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they are egregious is in the eye of the beholder, but they all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">involve a lot of money, so I think that is the common<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">denominator. There are several dimensions in Medicare. And to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">put it in proper context, Medicare's improper payments last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">year were estimated to be a little over $13 billion. That is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lot of money. It is important to note that not all improper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">payments represent waste, fraud, abuse and mismanagement. In<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some cases it is a situation where we paid twice and we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ultimately recover down the road, but shouldn't have paid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">twice. Now that $13.2 billion roughly is way too high, but it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is also down from about $24 billion several years ago. We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">making some progress but we have a ways to go.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>As you can imagine, given the amount of money in Medicare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and given the fact that most of Medicare is administered by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">third parties, there are tremendous opportunities for gaming<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and that is an area we need to stay on top of.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Another example is we are not getting the best deal on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare. You would think Medicare would be getting the best<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prices. We are not always getting the best prices that one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would expect we would get given the size of the purchaser we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are. The Federal Government is not always going after people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for debt collection either.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>On Medicaid: Medicaid represents a high risk area and is on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a high risk list along with Medicare. Medicaid is a tremendous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">financial burden for States. It is probably one of their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">biggest and fastest growing financial burdens. States are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trying to come up with innovative ways to increase their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal payment. Some would call them schemes, and we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">constantly have to be vigilant to make sure that we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fighting against schemes that result in the Federal Government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">paying more than it should.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Earned income tax credit, several billion dollars a year<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with regard to the earned income tax credit. Now in fairness,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this is a dual issue. For one thing, it needs to be streamlined<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and simplified. It is just way too complex and we need to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">streamline and simplify it so people who are truly deserving of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">getting the unearned income tax credit can do so. On the other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hand, we also need to have more aggressive enforcement to make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sure that only those individuals who are truly eligible for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">benefit receive it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Food assistance: In the food stamp programs and the school<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lunch programs, there is evidence that there are significant<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instances where individuals who are not eligible to receive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">benefits. Again, we want to make sure that the people who are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eligible receive those benefits, but we got to have adequate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">transparency and appropriate enforcement and accountability<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mechanisms to make sure those who are not eligible in fact do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not receive the benefits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So I am focusing Mr. Chairman, right now on the fraud,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, abuse and mismanagement because that is the subject of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this hearing. We have specific examples and I have several of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">my managing directors here who can drill down as far as you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">want to go on any of these topics.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. I was amazed at--the travel card issue is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just amazing. The examples of cruises being purchased, you know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Carnival cruises, Celebrity cruises, Norwegian, Princess<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cruises. Again, these aren't going to add up to the national<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debt, but it is just amazing that this kind of thing continues<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to go on.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Is there a common denominator that you find in these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs? In looking at these programs, are there common<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">characteristics that are part of these programs that possibly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one reform or another might help us? Do they tend to be more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">health programs? Do they tend to be--I guess I am looking for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">common denominator and maybe you are not able to put it in that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">kind of a general term.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, there are certain common elements I would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">say. First, I think we have to recognize that when you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talking about fraud, waste and abuse, the greatest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">opportunities are where the most money is. The other thing we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can say is that for any system to work, whether it be a health<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">care system, a corporate governance system, or weapons<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">acquisition system, you really have to have three elements. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have to have incentives for people to do the right thing,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">transparency to provide reasonable assurance that people will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do the right thing because somebody is looking, and appropriate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accountability, which includes enforcement mechanisms with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">swift and sure penalties if people do the wrong thing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I would respectfully suggest that in health care we don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have the right incentives, transparency, and accountablity. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also don't have them in certain other areas, such as earned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">income tax credit. And I think part of the other problem it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that a lot of these areas are very complex. There are pages and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pages of rules and regulations. Anybody who, even in a good<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">faith effort, is trying to comply, might find it extremely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">difficult to comply.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Thirdly, I would say another common element, at least in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the case of health care, is that most of the claims<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">administration work is being done by third party<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">intermediaries. Since most of the work is being done by third<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">party intermediaries, we don't have adequate transparency about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who is getting paid for what. And the user of the services, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beneficiary, may not necessarily even see the bill. They don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">even know who is getting billed for what. So we don't have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">adequate checks and balances with regard to certain of these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">activities. So I think there are certain common elements.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I would be remiss, given that I am from GAO, if I didn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talk about needing to make sure these agencies and programs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">including the Medicare claims administration contractors, have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">appropriate internal controls in place to provide for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">appropriate checks and balances. These internal controls<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">minimize the possibility of improper payments in the first<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instance, rather than having to try to go back and recover<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">after the money is already gone.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Thank you, General. David Walker has to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">leave by noon and we have a lot of good bipartisan interest in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this hearing, so I am going to limit my time to the 5 minutes.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Let me direct your attention, General Walker,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to one particular provision on page 8 of your presentation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about outpatient drugs. You state there Medicare pays less<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prices set by drug manufacturers, not prices that providers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">actually pay. In September, 2001, we reported that in 2000,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare paid over $1 billion more than other purchasers in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">outpatient drugs that the program covers. CMS has not acted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">upon our recommendation, and you footnote that to a study which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was September 21, 2001. No response at all. Any explanation as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to why they wouldn't try to negotiate downward the prices?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Health Care.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>CMS has taken some action to try and eliminate some of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">disparities that existed between what the different contractors<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were paying for drugs. As General Walker indicated, we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">delegated a large portion of the Medicare program to private<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">contractors and there was some variation in of the payment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rates they were offering, which was a source of excessive<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">payment. But beyond that, we are still operating with the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">system that we had in place in 2001, in which we were paying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the prices that drug manufacturers post but no one necessarily<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pays.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Isn't it a fact that the Veterans<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Administration more or less dictates or administers the prices<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it will pay?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scanlon. The Veterans Administration operates under<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">statute that provides for a Federal supply schedule price. What<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Congress has done is to use the leverage of the Medicaid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program and said that if a drug manufacturer wants to sell its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drugs to Medicaid beneficiaries, then it has to agree to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal supply schedule prices, which are the best price that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the drug manufacturer offers any purchaser. The Veterans<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Administration, DOD, and public hospitals all get that price.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. And it is substantially lower?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scanlon. Much, much lower.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Couldn't we save billions then if Medicare did<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the same thing?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scanlon. We need to think about how Medicare differs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the Veterans Administration in terms of the delivery of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drugs, but we can save billions by taking into account what the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">market prices are that drugs are available for and have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare pay based on those prices.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Let me read you a provision that is in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prescription drug bill coming to the House floor shortly called<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">noninterference. In carrying out its duties with respect to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provision of qualified prescription drug coverage to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beneficiaries under this title, the Administrator may not, one,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">require particular formulary; two, interfere in any way in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">negotiations between PDP sponsors and drug manufacturers,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wholesalers or other suppliers of outpatient drugs; and, three,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">otherwise interfere with the competitive nature providing such<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">coverage through sponsors and organizations.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Does that mean the Federal Government would have to tie its<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hands and not use the clout of 40 million Medicare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">beneficiaries and negotiate downward prices?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scanlon. It actually would tie the hands of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government less than today. Right now, the statute requires<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that the government pay on the basis of a price called the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">average wholesale price, which I indicated was not a price. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provision in the prescription drug bill would allow the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">operators of these drug plans the leverage to negotiate their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prices. They will probably do better than we are doing today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. But they could do still better if they did what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Veterans Administration does, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scanlon. That certainly is the case. When you are using<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the leverage of the entire Medicaid population and the Medicare<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">population you do have incredible leverage. You need to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sensitive to the fact that the deal that you are going to get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when you bring in a lot more consumers is not going to be as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">good as the deal that the Veterans Administration is getting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Let me touch on that if I can. Part of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem that we have is that government tends to look in silos.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">VA wants to get the best deal it can get. DOD wants to get the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">best deal it can get. The government is paying--actually, as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all know, government has no money, government is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">clearinghouse. So if the taxpayers are paying, then we need to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">figure out how we can act more collectively so we can leverage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">our purchasing power. What that might mean is that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government and the taxpayers get a better deal in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">aggregate, but maybe each agency doesn't get the same deal and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some won't get quite as good a deal as they are getting right<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now. On the other hand in the aggregate we are better off. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">need to start acting that way, in the collective best interest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the country, of the taxpayers rather than everybody trying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to maximize their own deal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. So Medicare should use the collective clout of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">40 million beneficiaries to negotiate prices with drug<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">suppliers, wholesalers and manufacturers?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, I would say that we need to use the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">collective power of Medicare, Medicaid, civilian health care,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">military health care, et cetera, which is a lot more than 40<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">million in order to get the best deal possible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Thank you very much.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Mr. Schrock.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Schrock. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, General,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for being here. This is the topic I am not sure we are going to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get our hands around and I have been sitting here thinking the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many minutes we have sat here and it is $69,000 a second, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that is overwhelming to think about. And when I look at the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">list you have here on some of the things they are spent on, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I know that I am a big supporter of DOD but I am just getting a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">little tired of some of the things that are going on over there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as well, that we have to get our hands around this.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I noticed you had here--this sheet you provided us, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">high risk list. And apparently there were some issues for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">managing large procurement operations more efficiently. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they said they apparently tried to change some of that in 1992,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">DOD contract management. I am here to tell you that it is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">working. It is an absolute disaster. I don't care what they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said they fixed in 1992. It is not working. DOD financial<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">management I am not sure is working. Systems modernization,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whatever. But when we come up with some of these programs to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">change it, it doesn't change, I think what is the point. How<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can we get our hands around it? And I read all these things.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And if I worked for somebody--if I had people working for me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who took credit cards and went to Cheetah's Lounge and Deja Vu<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Showgirls, I would fire them so quick it would make your head<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spin. I don't care whether they are civil servants or not, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would go. But are we keeping these people around? Are we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">getting rid of them? Are we trying to get them to pay back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their visit to Cheetah's Lounge, wherever the devil that is?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. We and the IG are trying to follow up to find<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">out what type of action is being taken. I think it is important<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to note that with regard to the cards issue, there are two<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sides of this coin. Clearly this is an example of fraud, waste<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and abuse for which we should have zero tolerance, and we need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be serious about dealing with offenders. At the same time, I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">think we also have to recognize that when we went to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">purchase card system, we actually saved the taxpayers a lot of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">money in the aggregate because we eliminated a lot of paperwork<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and a lot people who pushed papers to be able to do that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So yes, we need to have zero tolerance, but we don't want<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to taint the fact that we saved a lot of money by using<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">purchase cards.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Schrock. I understand. I don't know if it is Mr. Spratt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who said it or not, but I too am concerned about the offshore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">businesses and what is going on there and I don't know how we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get our hands around it. I was part of the group that went to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that press conference where we said we were going to reduce the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budgets by 1 percent, and I think if we can't there is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">something horribly wrong with this government, if we can't cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it by 1 percent. But what I am afraid is they will cut meat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">instead of the fat; instead of trying to figure out where the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, fraud and abuse is, that they won't do that. They will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pick something that really needs to be done, and I don't know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">how you prevent that from happening.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And in the past--I will tell you when I was in the Navy,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and I have told this story a million times and people are going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to get sick hearing it--I ran an operation in California and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">got to be September time frame and the comptroller from my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">organization back at the Pentagon would call and say you have X<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number of dollars left. You darn well better spend it. I don't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">care what you spend it on, you better spend it, because if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't you want get a plus-up next year. What nonsense is that?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I said I can't do that. He said you have to do it. I didn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and they didn't like it very much. I am here, so it didn't hurt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">me too bad. But that attitude goes on and on everywhere in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government. How do we get our hands around that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Let's take DOD, for example, we have had a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number of exchanges with regard to acquisitions. DOD is No. 1<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the world in fighting and winning armed conflicts. They are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the global gold standard. Nobody is even close. So we are an A-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">plus in effectiveness. We are No. 1. DOD is a D in economy,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">efficiency, transparency and accountability, in part because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they have not really focused enough efforts in building the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">basic management infrastructures that are necessary no matter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who the Secretary of Defense is, and no matter who the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">President is.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So we end up having a lot of waste, economy, and efficiency<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problems. I will give you two examples on DOD. In our view, DOD<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">should absolutely have to follow commercial best practices with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">regard to contracting and weapons system's, both the design and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">acquisition, unless there is a clear and compelling national<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">security reason not to. They don't do that. In form they do, in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">practice they don't. That is billions. In addition to that,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">believe it or not, we have something called the Prompt Payment<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Act, which says if we don't pay contractors on a timely basis<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we have to pay them penalties. On the other hand, if we overpay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them and they don't tell us and they benefit from that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">overpayment for months or years, they don't even have to pay us<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">interest. We need to think about how we can level the playing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">field on some of these things as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Schrock. In the Pentagon--and I am not trying to pick<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the Pentagon. Believe me, I worked there for a number of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">years, so I know some of the problems. They have certain people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that are going to be there forever and ever. They see the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">uniform people come in and say we don't like them. We will just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">wade them out because in 2 years they are gone. They see the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">political appointees come in and they know they are only going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be there as long as the President is in office. And it just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">keeps getting worse and worse and worse. And I think that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what Secretary Rumsfeld is trying to get his hands around. He<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is getting pinged on a lot about it, but I think he is trying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to get his hands around it. I am not sure how he ever does<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. I thank the gentleman, and I would like to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">take the Chair's prerogative to welcome State Representative<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Willard Jenkins and his wife Kay from Iowa.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Emanuel.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Emanuel. I would like to welcome him as well. First of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all, I appreciate doing this hearing and your time in this and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your perspective that you got to look at this from an aerial<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">perspective, which is both on the waste, fraud and abuse side<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as well as on the economy and efficiency standard. First, I got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two parts, one on the waste, fraud and abuse and then on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">economy and efficiency. But my own view is that since we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now going to be in Iraq for a good time, I would hope your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">agency is looking at how we are spending our dollars, and there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are two stories that come to mind.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Last week the New York Times ran a story that we give<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">people in Iraq $20 a day for no-show jobs who aren't showing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">up. I am from Chicago. We think we know something about no-show<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jobs. And there was an American official there in the article<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the New York Times who said who could quibble with that. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would like to raise my hand. I could quibble with that. So I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hope as we spend our time and resources in Iraq that you guys<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are going to spend your time looking at how we are spending our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dollars.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And I also bring your attention to a story over the weekend<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by AP that showed that Halliburton, which got a no bid contract<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which was originally set for $77 million is now running at $184<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">million. That is for a no bid contract. So I don't know if it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gets the label waste, fraud or abuse. I would hope that given<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that we are now on the ticket for $1.67 billion in Iraq, with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the dollars going and it is only going to continue over the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">next 10 years, that your agency continues to look at how we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spend our dollars in Iraq and make sure that not only are we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">getting the most out of it but that you are a watchdog because<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that should not become a bottomless pit to our operation.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Second, to the issue of efficiency and economy, and I know<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this hearing is on the waste, fraud and abuse area, but as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are debating the prescription drug benefit and on the health<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">care area, I look forward to the day in which we got free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">market principles, as it relates to the pharmaceutical area, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it relates to the area of our patent laws and the frivolous<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lawsuits pharmaceutical companies impose on generic companies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that prevent generics. Wall Street Journal did a story last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">week that generics are bringing down the price of drugs and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also bringing down health care inflation, that we could then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get generics to market quicker, we would actually control<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">costs. We would not have a captive market that allowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pharmaceutical companies to participate in frivolous lawsuits.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Second, if our consumers were allowed to import from--like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we do cars, steel, wheat, meat, other products, from Germany,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">France, England, other major industrial nations, we are--our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">consumers are paying and also the government as an agent is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">paying 30-300 times more than for the same drugs that people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">overseas are paying in Europe. And if we had the free market<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">principle operate in that area, we would bring down the cost of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">drugs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>And finally in the area of taxes, there isn't a single<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cancer drug or AIDS drug that hasn't been developed with U.S.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxpayer dollars, and yet we get no return on our investment. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">worked in the investment area. The IR return on equity in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">private sector is 30 percent. We don't even get 10 percent in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this country. You know in the private sector world when you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't get a return like that you are called dumb money. And we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">treat the taxpayer money--no drug today in cancer, AIDS or any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">area is not developed without U.S. taxpayer backed research.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I am not just talking about on the R&amp;D scale. I am talking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about directly out of NIH and so when we look at efficiencies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and economy, we need to start looking, and allowing the free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">market principles to start operating in the pharmaceutical<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">area. I would hope also your agency would begin to look at that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">area, give recommendations to how we can get the most out of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">our tax dollar.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Let me address both topics. First Iraq: We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on the case. I announced about 2 months ago in front of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Armed Services Committee that under my own authority as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Comptroller General that we were going to be doing work with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">regard to general contracting activities in Iraq, not targeting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">specific companies, but while nobody is off the radar screen,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looking at all major activities, and we are doing that. We have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">two people in Iraq right now. We expect we will end up having<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">more people come in periodically to do work in a range of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">areas, and we will be staying on the case. We are also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">coordinating our activities with the Inspector Generals of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Department of Defense and AID because we don't want to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">duplicating efforts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I might also add for the record that our son Andy, who is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Marine Corps company commander, just came back from Iraq.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Emanuel. Thank you for his service.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Secondly, on the drug issue, that is an example of the need<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for targeting. We already have a $5.8 [trillion]-$5.9 trillion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gap between promised benefits and funded benefits under Part A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of Medicare. That is just Part A, not Part B. So there is going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to have to be targeting for prescription drugs no matter what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">because we already have a huge hole that we have to fill up.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>You made a good point about drug costs here. Our son lived<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in Yuma, which is right on the border with Mexico. People<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">regularly went right across the border and bought the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">exact drug for a big percentage discount from what people in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Arizona bought it for. My personal view is there are a range of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">issues. They are very complex. It is probably our No. 1<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">domestic policy challenge, and we are on that case as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Emanuel. Thank you. I see my time is up. Thank you, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Brown.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, General<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Walker, for coming and giving us such good insight on what is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">happening. It is a real refreshment to hear somebody who really<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">has concern. I guess my point is not a question but what can we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do in the legislature to help enforce some of the items that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you have discovered?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, first, I think it is critically important<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to conduct active and ongoing oversight of all major programs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">policies and activities. We have a fiduciary obligation to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxpayers to do that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Secondly, I think Congress needs to relook at all of GAO's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">matters for consideration that require legislation, and ask<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">``why not.''</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Thirdly, I think the departments and agencies need to be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">held accountable as part of the oversight process for why they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have not adopted GAO recommendations. Fortunately, 79 percent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the recommendations that we made 4 years ago have been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">adopted, but 21 percent haven't. Furthermore there are some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">areas where I think legislation is going to be necessary. For<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">example, the imbalance between the fact that we have to pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">penalties when we don't pay on time, but if we overpay somebody<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they don't even have to pay interest. I mean that is something<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that is going to take legislation. Those are a few examples.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Brown. We mentioned about the high cost of medicine,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and Gil Gutknecht who is member of this committee, and has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a big proponent of trying to find some equity in resolving the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">differences between Europe and Mexico and Canada, I guess, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the prices of medicine here. Do you have any recommendations<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">along those lines that we might be able to get something moving<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rather than just keep talking about it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, we are doing work right now in that area.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">We are doing a great deal of work on health care because I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">believe that is our biggest domestic challenge. Basically what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is happening is we are paying for most of the world's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pharmaceutical R&amp;D. Most of the world has price controls on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prescription drugs. I am not saying that is good or bad. It is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just a fact. As you know, there are pros and cons to price<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">controls. We have had experience in our country with them. But<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the simple fact of the matter is that most of the rest of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">world has price controls. We don't, and the effect of that is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we have more innovation in prescription drugs in this country<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than anywhere in the world, but we also pay more than our fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">share of the R&amp;D for those drugs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>One out of the box thought that I will throw out, is that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we have all kinds of multilateral negotiations to deal with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">issues where there is a global benefit. Why aren't we engaging<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in some type of multilateral efforts to figure out how we can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">avoid undercutting innovation with regard to drugs have a more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">equitable allocation of associated costs on a global basis. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't even know if that is on anybody's radar screen, but it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">an important issue.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Brown. What would it take for us to get there? We all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">know the problem. What is the solution?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, let me think a little bit more on it and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I will get back to you. I wish I had performance based comp.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">these companies take into account. Multinational agreements on pricing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Ms. Baldwin.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Baldwin. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">could, for you to briefly recap or summarize the factors that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get a program on the high risk list. And I have follow-ups, so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just a summary would be ideal.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. There are quantitative factors and there are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">qualitative factors that deal with whether or not somebody is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on our high risk list. And I might add that this is on our Web<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">site, which is www.gao.gov. It is a process that we went<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through about 3 years ago that included involving comments from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the executive branch agency so that they thought we were being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fair about this. On the quantitative side generally it has got<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to involve something that is a billion dollars or more at risk.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Now a billion dollars is real money. Obviously we are concerned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about things below that, but it has got to involve at least a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion dollars or more in money. On the qualitative side it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">has to deal with safety, security, service delivery, a variety<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of other factors, and it is all laid out in detail on that Web<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">site.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So we have criteria not only as to how you get on, but we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">also have criteria as to how you get off, which generally means<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that you have demonstrated a commitment. You have a plan. You<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have made substantial progress. You are not done yet, but we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are convinced that you are taking it seriously. You have made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enough progress. You have enough of a plan to where we believe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ultimately you can be successful and that as a result sometimes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs and/or operations come off.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Baldwin. Again, for clarity, your high risk list<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">includes both mandatory and discretionary spending programs?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. That is correct. It includes both mandatory and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discretionary. And it also includes both tax and spending. For<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">example, the earned income tax credit is on there.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Baldwin. And for further clarity, your presentation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">started with the three levels of inquiry vulnerable for abuse,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud, the promise of efficiency, economy, effectiveness, et<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cetera. Can you be in a high risk category for any of those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">levels, or is it just relating to the abuse, fraud and waste?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. It can relate to one or all three. Quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">frequently it is several of the elements. My personal view is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that if you look quantitatively, the biggest money is in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">third element, the second biggest money is in the second<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">element, the least money is in the first element, which is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud, waste, abuse and mismanagement. There is big money in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all three.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>However, I think the other thing that you have to consider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is the confidence of the public in government operation to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">extent that the public sees things that they view as fraud,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste and abuse, even though it may not be as much money as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">economy, efficiency and effectiveness or the last tier, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">can undermine public confidence and you can't really put a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">price tag on that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Baldwin. Well, I appreciate the point you have just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">made that the big money is in level three, and you know, so on,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">working backwards. Because as you know, the budget resolution<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">section 301 requires the authorizing committees of this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Congress to identify changes in law by September 2 of this year<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that would require or would result in a reduction of mandatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending to eliminate fraud, waste and abuse. So we are talking<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about all three levels, one that probably will produce the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lesser of the three levels, and we are only talking about the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mandatory programs, not the discretionary programs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I sit on the Judiciary Committee in addition to this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">committee, and the mandatory spending under the oversight of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Judiciary Committee includes compensation for radiation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">exposure, the September 11 funds for victims, witnesses and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">expenses at trials, public safety officer death benefits and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">independent counsel. Are any of those on your high risk list as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">being particularly vulnerable for waste, fraud or abuse?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Not at the present time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Baldwin. OK. Are any of them likely to be added to that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">list before September 2 when we are to report back on changes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in law?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. No. But I think it is also important to note<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that we only issue our high risk list every 2 years. The most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recent was January of this year. We won't issue another one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">obviously until January 2005. So no, we won't have added the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">areas you mentioned.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Baldwin. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. Thank you very much and I appreciate you being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with us. Two questions: Mr. Spratt mentioned during his opening<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">remarks the initiative of the Clinton administration right at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the beginning of their term headed by Vice President Gore and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">opined that the savings might have been in the hundreds of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">millions of dollars. Have you had a chance to look back over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that? Did we call it reinventing government? Something like<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that. And have you had----</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. National Performance Review. It was focused on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reinventing government. We have issued reports on it and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">probably won't be a surprise that it saved more money than some<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">argue, but not nearly as much as was claimed. So that is kind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the story of life. It is somewhat in the middle.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. And what would that figure be and are we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">continuing to realize savings from it or did we sort of drop<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I will be happy to provide for the record or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provide to you directly a copy of the report that we issued. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't recall the details off the top of my head. But this is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">never ending process. This is something where we can never be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">off the case. In addition, it is not just the executive branch,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but also it is the legislative branch. There has to be active<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and ongoing and assertive oversight, and candidly I don't think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Congress has done enough of that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. I think you are right. The latest report that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you are talking about, when was it issued?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Oh, it was issued early in the current<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">administration, I believe. But I will provide the exact date<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the record.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. Do you recall if the National Performance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Review dealt mostly with discretionary spending or did it get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on over into the mandatory, which are the big ticket items?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I believe it dealt with both, but it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">primarily discretionary. But again I will provide more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">resulting in claims that were understated.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>NPR encompassed a wide range of different initiatives during the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">years it existed. NPR's efforts ranged from focusing on specific agency<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reforms to major crosscutting efforts, such as those to downsize the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal Government and to streamline acquisition and regulatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">processes, and included recommendations on both mandatory and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discretionary programs. For example, NPR recommended the Department of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Health and Human Services pursue options to ensure that adequate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">investments are made to avoid unnecessary payments from the trust funds<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">improve its contracting practices. Although progress has been made in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">many of the areas that NPR focused on, more needs to be done. Both the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare program and NASA contract management, for example, have been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on GAO's high-risk list since its inception in 1990 and continue to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">experience problems that must be resolved. Our work examining<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">governmentwide management reform efforts points to the importance of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">combined efforts by agencies and executive branch leadership along with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">support and oversight from Congress.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. OK. I appreciate that, and I look forward to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>My second line of questioning is concerning government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">payments for medical mistakes. For example, if an employee of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hospital administers the wrong medicine, causing harm to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">patient, it is my understanding that if that patient is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare recipient, Medicare pays for the wrong medicine that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">was administered first and then pays the cost of correcting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that bit of medical malpractice. If a Medicare recipient goes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in for an amputation and the physician amputates the wrong<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">foot, for example, then Medicare would pay to go back in and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pay to amputate the right foot. Have you looked into this, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do you have any idea how much we are spending as a Federal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Government to correct medical errors?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Dr. Bill Scanlon just confirmed my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding. You are correct. Medicare does pay for it. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have not looked into it historically. That may be an area that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">either we or the IG for Health and Human Services ought to look<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">into. As you might imagine, probably the area where we have the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">biggest supply and demand imbalance for request for work versus<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">resources to do it is health care. But part of that is the way<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you are putting your finger on a good point because it is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just the cost. Obviously in a couple of the examples that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">gave, I would imagine there would be a lot of litigation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">associated with the error because of the personal harm done as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. Well, and I think probably we are too<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">litigious, and I voted for legislation to correct that and to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sort of get the pendulum swinging back in the other direction.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But I think there is no question that malpractice exists just<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">as lawsuit abuse exists, and it just seems to me that there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ought to be some way, where when it is clear that the provider<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">itself has caused the damage, that the provider should not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">benefit monetarily from correcting that at the expense of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, I think it is an area worth looking into.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think the key is what you just said, ``when it is clear.''<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">How do you define that? In a circumstance as clear as the one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that you posited, I think all reasonable people would agree, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shouldn't be paying twice. The question is, where do you draw<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the line.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Wicker. I guess the first question would be how to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">start quantifying that. Maybe I have identified a problem that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is so small that we don't need to look at it, but I frankly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">doubt that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, one of the things I will do when we go<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">back is to find out whether or not things like the example that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you gave activities, would be deemed to be an, ``improper<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">CMS should observe the radar screen, no doubt about and then<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">determine what, if anything, should be done legislatively. If<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it takes legislation or whether something can be done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">since this committee last met we have had the deficit estimate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">considering that we now face the largest deficit in American<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker, I would like to ask you this question. Perhaps<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Dr. Scanlon will need to come up. I will leave that to you. Is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Edwards. OK. I would appreciate that. Let me go to what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I consider the biggest waste in the Federal Government and that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is interest on the national debt. In your chart, Mr. Walker,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you showed 7 percent of the government goes to interest on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">national debt, and I consider that waste because it doesn't buy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one college student a college loan or a Pell Grant. It doesn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">train one Army soldier, it doesn't pave one highway. Could you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tell me when you add net interest on the national debt? Would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you define for me the difference between gross interest on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debt and net interest on the debt? Are you subtracting interest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">income when you use the 7 percent number? And if you do, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would really mean that we are going to continue to bring in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">interest income. It would really mean the debt payments, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">interest from the debt, the debt tax is really greater than 7<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent of the budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I believe that is correct, and we will also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">provide those numbers. I think the key is that obviously we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not getting anything for interest on the debt now. And part of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the question is what caused the debt to arise? What was the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nature of the activity that caused it to rise? Then I think you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would have to say whether or not there is any value, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Edwards. Let me ask you this. Is most of our national<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debt funded on a short-term basis now compared to 10 or 20<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">years ago?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. It is clearly a shorter term than it was. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of course we had a period of time where we thought we were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">going to pay it all off, and that didn't happen.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Edwards. So if we assume, as Mr. Greenspan has said,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that massive borrowing by the government will drive up interest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rates, that will also drive up the cost of our borrowing to pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the interest on our national debt. Has the GAO done any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">kind of analysis to assume if, for example, the long-term<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">interest rates, the treasury bill interest rates went up 2<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percentage points what that would mean in extra expenditures by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the taxpayers to pay for interest on the national debt?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. We haven't, but it is a very easy calculation<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to do. Let me also clarify my understanding of what this 7<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent is--it is interest on debt held by the public. As you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">know, there is a substantial amount of debt that is held by so-</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">called trust funds which in reality aren't trust funds. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are really accounting devices. This 7 percent is just on debt<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">held by the public.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Edwards. And the interest on the debt, that 7 percent,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one of the largest five programs in the Federal Government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would actually go up dramatically if interest rates went up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">perhaps two full percentage points over the next couple of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">years because of our massive deficit spending, is that correct?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. It would go up, but probably the biggest threat<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is the size of the deficits that we are undertaking right now.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Edwards. You could make some assumptions, make an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">assumption if interest rates go up 1 percent, 2 percent or 3<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent how much that would mean in extra costs to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxpayers for paying for that wasteful program, the interest on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the national debt. I assume that could be just a simple<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for the extraordinary work of the GAO. It is an invaluable tool<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and if there is any message in what I think we have learned in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the last few years, it is to take the reports of the GAO and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">act on them. And I am pleased that we are beginning to try to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">get the authorizing committees, besides the Budget Committee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the appropriators, to look at this legislation, look at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your reports, because much of it is mandatory spending that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">requires authorizing changes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I want to just first respond to the issue of the national<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debt. I believe the national debt is a crucial way of concern<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the interest we pay on the national debt, and I believe the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reason why you are seeing members on our side of the aisle<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">focus on this issue is to reduce the debt by getting the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">economy moving again. It is a fact that the biggest contributor<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to the national debt is the decline in revenues, or the slowing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of revenues. And if we could get revenues up to where they were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in previous years, we would have no deficits and our national<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debt wouldn't keep increasing. So we are focusing our effort on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looking at waste, fraud and abuse and getting this economy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">moving again.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Let me just focus on two areas of waste, fraud and abuse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that just bug the heck out of me and I don't hear it spoken of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">much on the other side of the aisle. One is something that I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">call, that is referred to as the earned income tax credit,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which to me is a surprising word because I don't know what is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">earned about this tax credit. It is paid to people who pay no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxes. We understand from reports that you have done that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">earned income tax credit, that $9.3 billion, or nearly 30<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">percent of the total $31.3 billion claimed by taxpayers is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">erroneous. Is that number still a fact? It has been the last 5<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. It is a realistic estimate on the percentage<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">basis. Unfortunately, the IRS hasn't updated it, but they have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taken a number of different steps to try to deal with it. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">assume that it probably hasn't changed much.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Shays. So for these individuals who pay no income tax,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they pay other taxes but pay no income taxes, we are looking at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nearly one-third of all of the so-called earned income tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">credit being given out erroneously. How do we deal with it?<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">What do we do about it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, I think there are two dimensions. First,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think one of the things that this is intended to do is to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">encourage and reward individuals who actually work and who are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">actually earning income and coming off of the welfare rolls,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and that is something on which I think there probably can be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bipartisan consensus, that we want to try to get people off of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">welfare into work. Also recognizing that we have some perverse<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">incentives in our Federal system. As you are going to find out<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in a forthcoming report, one could argue that the best health<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">care coverage we have is Medicaid, which is welfare for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">indigent. So we have some perverse incentives. I think there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are two answers.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>First, we need to streamline and simplify so that we can<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">more effectively communicate who is eligible and who is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eligible for the earned income tax credit. Complexity is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem. Second, the IRS needs to enhance its enforcement<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">activities. But we have to have a balance. On the one hand, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">want people who are eligible for the credit to be able to get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it. On the other hand, we do not want people who are not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eligible to benefit from it. It is a combination of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">simplification and enforcement.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Shays. But the bottom line is nearly $10 billion is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">being paid out erroneously to people who do not qualify, and it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seems to me this committee and other committees need to pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">attention to that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Let me just ask you about food stamps, another important<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program. It is a program that is supposed to help those with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the least income. According to reports that we have from your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">department, we have a 9 percent error rate; in other words,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">$1.4 billion is paid erroneously. Now, in this case one billion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">represents an overpayment and $400 million an underpayment. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in either case, that is wrong, correct?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. That is correct. I mean we want people that are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">eligible to get the benefits. But the ones that aren't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">shouldn't.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Shays. And so what should we be doing here? How can we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">make sure that we don't have waste, fraud and abuse in the food<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">stamp program?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I would like Dr. Posner to come up for a second<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if it is OK. He is one of our experts with regards to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">details here. Is that alright, Mr. Chairman?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Yes. Please identify yourself for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">record.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Posner. I am Paul Posner, managing director for our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">work on budget and intergovernmental programs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Basically there are a number of things that have been done<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">over the years to address this. One is----</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Shays. There is a red light on, and so I know other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">members have very little time, so real quick.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Posner. OK. One is to give more incentives to the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">States to do a better job in pursuing this kind of thing. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">other is electronic benefits transfers to reduce trafficking in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">food stamps, which will really improve oversight of a real<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">abuse in the system. But the incentives to the States are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">really important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Shays. OK. Thank you. I am sorry for the need for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">short answer. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Can I get the other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one? This chart shows how we have been budgeting. The chairman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is very reluctant to talk about how we got to where we are, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I think it is instructive because you see all the red ink being<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">run up during the Reagan and Bush administrations. The green<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part is what happened in----</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Will the gentleman yield just briefly?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. I yield.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. All I am suggesting--all I was suggesting<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is that there are probably two sides to the story. That is all<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I was suggesting. I know I have a side. I know you have a side.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">I just thought it was maybe not necessary to go into that today<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is all I was suggesting.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Reclaiming my time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Please.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. I understand why you don't want to go into it. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just want to say that as a Member on this side, we voted for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the green and we voted against the red. So when we start<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talking about which was the Democratic plan and these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">amendments, some of these amendments are dealing with the mess<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that has been created, the best good faith effort. But if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">want to know what the Democratic plan is, look at the green.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Now, the next chart is what this mess puts us in. That<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">green sloping line is what General Walker referred to as we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">were going to pay off the national debt. That was what the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">projection was when this new administration came in. The red is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the interest on the national debt we are going to pay. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">blue, just to put things into perspective, is the defense<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Now, General Walker, you have pretty well disparaged the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">idea that we are going to grow ourselves out of this mess and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">said these are tough choices. Is the fact that one-half of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">2001 tax cut--if it had been that same amount of money had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">allocated to the Social Security problem--that we could have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">solved the Social Security problem with that amount of money?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Candidly, based upon GAO's long range budget<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">simulations which we do twice a year, if we can enhance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">economic growth that will help. The gap is too great in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">long term to grow our way out of the problem. Therefore, tough<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">choices are going to have to be made with regards to tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">policy, including tax incentives, spending policy, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">regulatory policy. You are not going to avoid that, and quite<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">frankly,we need to get on with it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>EITC, how much would it cost to fix the problem?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. How much would it cost to fix it? I think you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are making a good point here, Mr. Scott. In some cases in order<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to fix the problem you have to spend a little bit of money, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have to spend to save. And there could be a net savings once<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you do that. This also ties to one of the things I think we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">need to be thinking about in the budget process which is how to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">look at discounted present value as well as annual cash flow<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">since sometimes the latter can cause us to do some unusual<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">things.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. About how much would it cost to fix the problem?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to evolve and an overall estimate remains unknown. IRS has received a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">dedicated appropriation for many years that is intended to help it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reduce the level of EIC overpayments while maintaining the program's<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fairly high participation rate. These appropriations totaled about $875<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">million between 1998 and 2003. However, the most recent IRS compliance<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">study found that EIC overpayments for tax year 1999 totaled between<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about 27 to 32 percent of dollars paid out, or between $8.5 and $9.9<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion. For fiscal year 2004, IRS has asked for a total of $251<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">status errors. A joint Department of the Treasury/IRS task force<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">estimated that the cost of the dedicated EIC appropriation for years<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">between 1998 and 2003 represented about 0.5 percent of the total EIC<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pieces of legislation since 1999, which could potentially improve<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">compliance rates. However, the effect on EIC compliance has been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">colleague from Virginia, mentioned the problem that if you cut<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">veterans benefits, you may be disqualifying people that are in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fact eligible. How do you save money with veterans benefits?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, veterans benefits frankly are like most<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">other entitlement programs. You want to make sure the people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who are truly entitled to benefits receive them but that those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who aren't, don't. There is more that has to be done, for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">example make sure we are not paying dead people.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Can we do that by cutting administrative<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">expenses?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. It is more complex than just how much money<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">there is. It is how the money is used.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. What is so complicated about sanctioning those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who abuse credit cards? I mean, has anybody ever gone to jail<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for trying to charge a personal cruise on a government credit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">card and passing the expense off to the government?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. To my knowledge, no. But the IG and us are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">following up on what DOD is doing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. So how is that any different? I mean why is this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">complicated? Why is it any different than just vouchering the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cruise to the Federal Government? Just going to Office Depot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and buying a computer and charging, taking it home and charging<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it off to the government? I mean that is theft. What is so<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">complicated about that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, I think the point you are making with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which I would agree is that when we find clear examples of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">abuse and illegal activity, we need to take specific actions.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There must be penalties that are paid to dissuade those who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would try to take advantage of this system from doing so.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. I thank the gentleman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett. Thank you. Just a couple of questions. One of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your points seems to be that if you want to save money, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">want to go after the big programs first. And Medicare, you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talking about $12 billion, and that comes out in my little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">computations around 5 percent of the program, roughly. We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">looking now depending on the bill before us at a prescription<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">program of either $400 billion, $600 billion or now maybe $1<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trillion. If all things hold true on the average of setting up<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">new programs going forward, if the 5 percent figure holds true,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are we looking at around a $20 billion possibility for waste,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud and abuse in this new program we are about to pass in one<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">form or another?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. There is little question in my mind that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">preventing fraud, waste and abuse will be a challenge in any<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">prescription drug program. There is also no question in my mind<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that one of the things Congress has to do is have more concrete<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">debate on the long term discounted present value--the long-term<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cost of any new legislation that is considering on either the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending or the revenue side. Today you do not have that. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have a big hole. Congress debates 10-year numbers but our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">biggest problem does not start until after the baby boomers<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">retire.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett. Can you provide us this committee or myself<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with what the real figure is, I guess, going forward under our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proposal as far as what the real costs will be when we hit that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">date?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. That is CBO's job. One of the things we have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recommended is that when you anticipate big, long-term numbers,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">especially when the cost starts going up after the 10-year<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">period, then separate calculations be done of the long-term<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fiscal exposure. I don't know whether or not CBO has done that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or not, but I think that would be important.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett. I mean, I saw one figure in the paper and I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't know where they got it, not from CBO, about $3.8<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trillion. I am going forward on that, so----</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, I think we have to recognize that we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">already have a $5.8 [trillion]-$5.9 trillion gap on Part A of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Medicare alone. That doesn't count Part B and that obviously<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">doesn't count prescription drugs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett. Right. And so this is just adding to that. One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the questions that my constituents had, and I am a new guy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">here so I have a hard time answering this, is when we say,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">well, we are not responsible for some of this because now we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are--almost over half is on the mandatory side and we have no<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">control over that. And they of course say, well, you are in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Congress, I thought you had control over everything. My<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">understanding, correct me if I am wrong, there is a number of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs which are in that category, which come under the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">authorized programs, right, that have been authorized in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">past but have not been reauthorized. And yet we continue to pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">on those programs. Is that how it works?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I am looking to my budget people real quick.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">This is Dr. Susan Irving, who is in our budget area. I want to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">make sure we get you a correct answer and right answer.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Ms. Irving. Mr. Chairman. I am Susan Irving, Director of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal Budget Analysis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The issue of unauthorized programs that still continue to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">receive funding is largely in the discretionary area of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budget. Every year CRS and CBO put out a list of unauthorized<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but appropriated programs. And in the past it has been held<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that the act of appropriation means the Congress implicitly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">authorizes the activity. For most of the mandatories, it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">kind of a direct spending. That is the spending flows directly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the authorizing legislation. Social Security is the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">obvious example. The amount of money that goes out is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">function of the eligibility rules and the payment benefit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">calculations. You do have control. You can change those, but<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not on an annual basis through the appropriations process.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. And that is the point. Congress ultimately has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the authority to act on what is mandatory as well as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">discretionary programs. It just hasn't always.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett. Right. So on the authorized ones, which are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">within the discretionary category, the courts are saying that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we are basically authorizing them all over again just by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fact that they appropriate the dollars. But we have the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">authority actually--right now NASA and a few other ones people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">say have not been reauthorized, but we just continue to do it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">And I see that NASA is one of the programs in here that you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">highlight. Not that I am picking on NASA. But I saw that in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">here as I thumbed through.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So these are things that we have the ability to control<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">through the authorization process and also through the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mandatory process but we opt not to do it is the record.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Congress has not done it. The area on the list<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is NASA contract management.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Garrett. Right. Thanks a lots.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. And just for the gentleman's information,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the CBO does have that information and per Mr. Spratt's request<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we will be holding a hearing on the long-term implications of a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number of these programs. That will be one of the next hearings<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that the Budget Committee holds.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since we are about to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have votes, Mr. Walker, I will try to be brief and I have to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ask you about something that my friend from Connecticut, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vice chair, was asking you about earlier. He asked you about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">what I think if you listen to the administration, one would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">believe is an epidemic of irresponsibility among poor people in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this country. If you listen to the administration or the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">inference of my friend from Connecticut's question, one would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">think that there is this huge problem with people who are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">getting foods stamps or who are getting school lunches or who<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are getting the earned income tax credit engaging in fraudulent<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">behavior. I have no doubt that there is some level of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraudulent behavior that goes on with those groups. But what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">very much concerns me is that frankly I don't see the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">level of attention and scrutiny being directed to folks who are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">engaged in corporate avoidance, for example. I had a chance to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">look at your high risk series book last night and it is an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">interesting piece of work. I am sure you will correct me if I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">am wrong, but as I looked through it I don't see a single<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reference to a corporate avoidance tax gain. Did I miss one or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is there one in here?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. No, we don't have that on here. Frankly----</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. Let me ask you another question since we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">running low on time. You have heard of something called sale<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in, lease out. You have heard of that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I am not an expert on it. I have heard about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. OK, and you have heard it is a kind of corporate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax avoidance game and you haven't taken an effort to become an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">expert on that either, have you?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Not to this point in time.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. And it is not referenced in your high risk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">series book, is it?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. That is correct. It is not.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. You have also heard that occasionally there is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem of some consulting firms marketing tax shelters that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">deal with inflated patent valuations. You have heard that is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem that exists?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Yes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. Is there a reference to that in your high risk<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. It is just ``unpaid taxes,'' period. It doesn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">make any difference what type.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. OK. And I will represent to you that I have read<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that section. There is no reference for--the word ``corporate''<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is not contained in it. Do you disagree with that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I haven't read it lately so----</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. Do you get the point I am making?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Oh, I understand your point.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. OK.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I only need to hear it once.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. And since I have got a little bit of time left I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">do want to leave you with this observation, Mr. Walker. One<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thing that I do think enormously frustrates a lot of people in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this country, and regardless of what party we come from, a lot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of our constituents are people who are frankly not making a lot<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of money. They are people who are earning between 10 and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">$25,000 a year and we recognize that, yes, some of those people<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are engaged in fraudulent conduct. But I think it must be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enormously frustrating and disheartening to them when they hear<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the administration focusing only on their irresponsibility<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whereas some of the wealthiest people in this country are doing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">things that could potentially cost us a lot of money and,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">frankly, we don't have the kind of laser focus on them.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Neal. Mr. Davis, would you yield for a second?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. No. I don't have a lot of time left, so I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">apologize.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Neal. It would be helpful to your argument.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. Well, let me finish my point. We have got a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">little bit of time left. The point that I want to make to you,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr. Walker, is this is what frustrates a lot of people, in my<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">opinion, before I yield to my friend from Massachusetts, that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">when the Republican administration wants to find a way to save<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">money they tend too look in very particular places.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I would be happy to yield to my friend from Massachusetts.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Neal. Thank you, Mr. Davis. Let me just ask you this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">quick question, Mr. Walker. Do you believe that Tyco is a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Bermuda based company?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. In form but not in substance. And let me say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this. I think it is important to respond. No. 1, I think if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">look at a number of my speeches and a number of GAO's work, you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will find that we have been very much on the case in trying to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">highlight that more attention needs to be paid to the tax side;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to preferences and incentives, and some of these abuses. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have also said that more needs to be done with regard to IRS<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enforcement. It is one thing to provide service and that means<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enforcement on all aspects of the tax code. And I think you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will also see that I have said a number of times and GAO has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">products noting a number of concerns with regard to not only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax abuse but also failures in corporate governance and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accountability under the current systems.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. Briefly reclaiming my time since I have a little<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bit left, the concern though, Mr. Walker, is you and your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">agency draft the high risk series book. Even when you chose to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">talk about tax avoidance the word ``corporate'' doesn't even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">surface on the pages that you all drafted. That is the omission<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that concerns some of us, that the fixation is on one end of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">society and not the other one.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Well, I will go back and look at that to make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sure. But the fact of the matter is if it isn't expressly noted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">who the individuals are, that is inappropriate because it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">across the board, and let me make clear to you, it is across<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the board.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Davis. I agree.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. We have time for one more inquiry, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">then we are going to have to recess for votes. Mr. Diaz-Balart.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Diaz-Balart. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You know, one of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the things that comes to mind is that with all these problems,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">if this is no accountability to those that are, you know,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">signing off or making the decisions, then nothing is ever going<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to happen. And Mr. Schrock asked the question what happens to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">those people that make those bad decisions that create the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fraud or that sign off on the fraud, and I believe that your<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">answer was really not much, right?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. We are following up to see what actions were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taken. We are willing to make sure that there is appropriate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accountability because the only way you are going to dissuade<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">further abuse is if you have swift and effective<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">accountability.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Diaz-Balart. Because, Mr. Chairman, as you know, with<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">your direction and your assistance after speaking with you, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with your blessing, many of us, the Republican freshmen, we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">created a working group to combat waste, fraud and abuse, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">some of the things that we have been able to find in a very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">short time span is really scary. Such numbers--the numbers are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">amazing. Even Medicare, $13.3 billion, or housing subsidy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs, $3.3 billion, or supplemental security income, $2.6<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion or unemployment insurance or disability insurance. And<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">these are funds that are being frankly misused or wasted by the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Federal Government and therefore are not going to those that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">really do need the assistance, which is why those programs were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">set up in the first place. So we have created this working<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">group. And not only--so I want to kind of use this opportunity,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Mr. Chairman, to kind of throw in a plug. We are going to use<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this working group not only to highlight some of these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">horrendous misuse of taxpayers' money, not only is it robbing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the taxpayer, it is also not going to those that truly need it.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But also hopefully come up with some ideas that we can help<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">this committee and others to try to show some possible<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">solutions. I think one of those has to be accountability, and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">until we have some serious accountability to those that are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">making the decision, until jobs are on the line, I don't think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that anything is ever going to change.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Chairman, so I want to thank you for this opportunity<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and I know we have very little time because we have to go vote.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. I would respectfully suggest that Congress is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part of the accountability mechanism as well. What kind of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">oversight you exercise and what do you do with regard to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">appropriations?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Diaz-Balart. Absolutely.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Congress has oversight responsibility that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it has not been utilizing. It needs to. One of the ways that it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">does that is through the General Accounting Office, as an arm--</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nonpartisan arm--of the United States Congress. Mr. Davis has<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">brought up a couple of items that I have no doubt, knowing that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you, Mr. Walker, and others with GAO, when you get ideas you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are all over it like a big dog on a piece of steak. So I have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no doubt that you will do that in this instance as well. You do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not work for the administration. I think you have demonstrated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that independence in many ways both from Congress as well as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">from the administration, and we appreciate it.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This is a start. We could go on all day, I know, for a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number of reasons, but this is a good start. We appreciate the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">time you have spent with us today. We know that your time is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">limited. You are going to have to leave by noon and our votes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will not be completed by that time. So at this point in time we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will dismiss you and begin with the second panel when we<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">reconvene the hearing.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Walker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I need to go start<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chewing on the steak.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Go do it. Thank you. And with that we will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">recess subject to the call of the Chair following the third<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vote on the floor. [Recess.]</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Call the committee back to order. This is the hearing on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">waste, fraud and abuse in Federal mandatory programs. We will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">resume now with the second panel, Robert S. McIntyre, who is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Director of Citizens for Tax Justice. We welcome you, Mr.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">McIntyre, to the committee. Your entire testimony will be made<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">part of the record, and we are pleased to hear your testimony<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and have you summarize that testimony at this point. Welcome.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>STATEMENT OF ROBERT S. MC INTYRE, DIRECTOR, CITIZENS FOR TAX<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">                            </span>JUSTICE</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. This is my first visit to the Budget<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Committee, despite working on tax issues for the last quarter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of century or so. So I appreciate the opportunity. Our group,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Citizens for Tax Justice, advocates for government fiscal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">policies based on two rather simple principles: One, that the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government ought to raise enough money to pay for the programs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that it enacts and, secondly, that it ought to do so in a fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and progressive way. Until recently, these weren't particularly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">controversial propositions.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Over the years, we have worked with members of both parties<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the Congress and the White House to try to achieve these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">goals and often with some success. These days, however, the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">idea of raising enough money to fund the government and raising<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it fairly puts us somewhat in disagreement, I think, with the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">current management in the Congress and the White House.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>This year, fiscal year 2003, the latest estimates show that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the on budget deficit will be $570 billion or more. That means<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that $1 out of every $3 that the government spends on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">everything but Social Security will be financed with borrowed<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">money. This is the highest level of borrowing to fund on budget<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending since World War II, nosing out an almost as high<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">number in President Reagan's first term, before he and I became<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">allies. Faced with this very dire fiscal situation, which shows<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">no sign of abating, it is very appropriate that this committee<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is starting to look at ways to stem the flow of red ink. We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">happy if we can help in that effort.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The focus here is on mandatory spending, an area which is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">one of the most important ones to look at. I haven't heard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">much, though, except for the earned income tax credit, about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax provisions that are part of the mandatory spending system,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and that is what I wanted to focus on today.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Every year, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Treasury Department put out lists about the total amounts of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">mandatory tax entitlements. The latest numbers from the Joint<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Tax Committee indicate that we will see $843 billion worth of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">those programs this year, and that will rise to $915 billion by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fiscal 2007. That is more than the total of all discretionary<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">appropriations. These are mandatory programs embedded in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax code, and I must say those numbers are actually low. They<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">leave out corporate tax shelters. They understate the tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">benefits of accelerated depreciation. They assume sunsets will<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">happen that probably won't. For a number of reasons the number<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is probably closer to $1 trillion in tax-based mandatory<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spending.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Of course, lots of these programs are probably things the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government would do whether it did it through the Internal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Revenue Service or a regular government agency. But many of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">them aren't, and I want to focus on the ones that almost surely<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">aren't, the large business subsidies that are embedded in our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax code that are benefiting industries from oil, nuclear,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ethanol, drug manufacturing, you name it, more than 75 of them<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">listed in the Joint Tax Committee list. I have a very strong<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">feeling that if any of these were proposed as direct spending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs out of the Commerce Department or the Environmental<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Protection Agency or whatever other agency would have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jurisdiction, that their chances of passing the Congress would<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be something close to zero. So I think they need some more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">scrutiny because they are so similar to regular spending<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We have had a concerted attack on these kinds of programs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">under President Reagan, who in the 1986 Tax Reform Act scaled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">way back on these subsidies for the very simple reason that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they were perceived, correctly, I think, by the administration<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and by the Congress, as wasteful, as violative of our free<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">market principles and as economically harmful in the long run.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>But things have changed since then. I know you hear from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">business lobbyists day in and day out about how horribly cruel<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we are to our corporations when it comes to taxes. The fact<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they can say that with a straight face suggests that they have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">had some very serious training, because as is well known if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just read the papers, many of our biggest companies are paying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">nothing at all in taxes. Overall, our taxes on corporations are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">now just about the lowest in the world as a share of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">economy. Only Iceland is slightly lower. How can they be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">complaining about high taxes when they are the lowest in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">world? I don't know how they get away with that.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>The reason that our corporate taxes have become so low, at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">least in recent years, has nothing to do with tax rates, but to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">an explosion in the mandatory subsidies in the tax code.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Recently, for instance, the Congress in 2002 and 2003 passed a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">vast expansion in tax breaks for depreciation write-offs, $114<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion in 2002 and then another $60 billion this year. The<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">combination of these changes, almost $180 billion in added<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corporate subsidies, has not received the attention that it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">needs. In fact, if the sunsets are not honored, and certainly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the lobbyists don't want them to be honored, these programs,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just the ones adopted in the last 2 years, will cost over $400<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">billion over this decade. So that is one area you ought to look<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>I mean, wouldn't it make sense if we want to tax our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">businesses on their profits that we tax them on what they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">actually make, not on some figment of their accountants'<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">imagination? Why do we want a system that taxes some companies<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">at much higher rates than others just depending on the mix of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their investments?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>A second area that I think you ought to look at is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">international. Our multinational companies have as their goal<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to pay as little taxes as possible. One way they try to do it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is to tell the Internal Revenue Service that they made their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">profits offshore. In recent years, the accounting firms have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">come up with ways for companies to take their U.S. profits and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">make them all of a sudden magically appear in Bermuda,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Barbados, Liechtenstein, or some other place where they are not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxed. As a result of that, most people who have looked at it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">think that we are probably losing to these subsidies something<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the order of $50 [billion] or $60 billion annually just from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">companies avoiding, or I think in many cases evading, their tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">responsibilities to the United States.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>There are ways to address this issue. They are not on the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">table in the Ways and Means Committee except to expand them,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but there are steps that could be taken that would save average<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ordinary taxpayers tens of billions of dollars a year. I think<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it is something you ought to look at.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Finally, as I said before, there are many industry-specific<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">subsidies in the code benefiting this industry or that for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">whatever political reason they were put in. I wonder why you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">would be supporting these programs, if you have any belief at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">all that businesses ought to make business decisions and that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the government shouldn't be running sort of a quasisocialist<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">state. Clearly because free market principles and these<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">subsidies are so inconsistent with one another.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So the bottom line is that on-budget revenues this year are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">going to be about 11\1/2\ percent of GDP. That is the lowest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">level since before World War II, and it is almost a quarter<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">below the level in fiscal 2000. This drop in revenues explains<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">most of the enormous deficits we face. And the vast expansion<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in tax based subsidy programs explains quite a lot of that. Of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">course the income tax rate cuts and so forth explain a lot of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">it, too.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>It seems to us that this committee and the Congress ought<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to look at tax based spending programs the same way you look at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">anything else. There is no real distinction except artificial<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">bookkeeping differences. Let me give you an example.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Suppose the earned income tax credit were not refundable,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">but instead poor families could sell their tax breaks to better<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">off families and get the money that way. That would show up as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a reduction in taxes rather than as spending, but it wouldn't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be a different program. If you think that is out of the blue,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">remember that corporations day in and day out sell their excess<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax breaks to companies that can use them. That makes the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corporate subsidies, whether it is the low income housing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">credit or accelerated depreciation or whatever, in essence<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">refundable. And yet, well, they don't get the attention. So it<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">seems to us that if this committee is serious, and I hope you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">are, in trying to reduce our government's unsustainable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">borrowing, then curbing unwarranted tax based entitlement<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs, especially the expensive tax subsidies for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corporations that fail to serve economic purposes and cost<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">me quickly highlight a few areas that ought to be given a very hard<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">look:</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">     </span>Excess depreciation write-offs. Beyond enforcing the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sunsets on the 2002 and 2003 misdirected ``stimulus'' bills, Congress<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">could go considerably further in curbing unwise depreciation tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">subsidies. If our goal is to tax corporations on what they really earn,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">then tax deductions for depreciation ought to be based on a reasonable<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">approximation of actual wear and tear, not used as a hidden subsidy<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that distorts investment behavior and interferes with fair competition.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In addition, depreciation write-offs on debt-financed investments could<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be disallowed, either completely or at least partially, as the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">actual foreign earnings: We give companies a full tax credit for the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rates and the phase-out of the estate tax explain much of this decline.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">But the vast expansion in tax-based subsidy programs, particularly the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">hundreds of billions of dollars annually for corporations, looms very<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">large as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Despite artificial bookkeeping differences, it seems obvious that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">programs should be evaluated on the same terms whether they are run by<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a regular government agency or by the IRS through the tax code. To do<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">otherwise would elevate form over substance, and make responsible<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">budgeting difficult or impossible.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>So if this committee is seriously interested in reducing our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">government's unsustainable borrowing binge, then curbing unwarranted<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">tax-based entitlement programs, especially the many expensive tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">subsidies for corporations that fail to serve any worthwhile economic<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">or social objective, should be high on the agenda.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Thank you.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. McIntyre. The previous witness<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pretty well disparaged the idea that we are going to grow our<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">way out of this mess. Do you agree with that?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. The idea that cutting taxes increases<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">revenues is a nice thought, but it has been tried before.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Remember under President Reagan when we were going to pay for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the defense buildup with the revenues generated by the tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cuts? A few trillion dollars in increased debt later, they<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">figured out that was a bad policy and we reversed it. In fact,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we managed to balance the on-budget budget for several years in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the late 1990s. So repeating that failed strategy seems to me<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to be, you know, foolish.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Could you put the deficit chart up? So you agree<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with his disparaging remarks?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. I do agree with his disparaging remarks. I<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">probably would state them even more strongly.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. This is the interest on the national debt that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we were going to pay--the interest on the national debt in red<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that we were going to pay in the defense budget. If we look at<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that chart and the increasing interest on the national debt and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Social Security deficit looming after 2017 and the full, as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you have suggested, 10-year cost of all the phased in tax cuts<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and the President's statement when he came in office that said<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that Social Security needs reform but not in such a way that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will adversely affect the benefits for those on retirement or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">those near retirement, opening up the question of what about<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">everybody else, how do you reconcile that statement, this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">chart, the Social Security deficit in any way that does not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">include a repeal of Social Security?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Well, we have big problems with Social<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Security due to the budget deficits that we are running. As you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pointed out, it is not too long from now when Social Security<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxes will not be enough to fund the program and Social<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Security will start to have to ask the government to pay back<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the money that Social Security lent it. And if the government<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">has a huge national debt and huge interest payments, it won't<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be able to afford to make those payments back to Social<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Security. That is one very important reason why we should be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">trying to get the budget back into balance and maybe into<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">surplus when the economy recovers so we will have the resources<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to pay the Social Security commitments that we have made.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. And if we don't do something drastic, is it fair<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to assume that we will not be able to afford Social Security?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. I suppose they could eliminate the Defense<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Department instead, but something has to give, yeah.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. One analysis was that in terms of tough choices,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the tax cut that the top one percent got in 2001 would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">enough money; if instead of spent on a tax cut, if it had been<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">spent on Social Security, it would have increased the surplus<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in Social Security such that we could have paid Social Security<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for 75 years without reducing benefits. Do you agree with that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">calculation?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Well, it is sort of contingent on the sunset<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in 2010. But ignoring the sunset, that is right. By 2010 half<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the 2001 tax cut will go to the wealthiest people and that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">will continue thereafter. And the size of the tax cut if it is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">extended is about double the Social Security problem. So yes.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Is there any chance we might solve this problem<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by tightening up the abuse of credit cards?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. No.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Is there any chance that we might solve this<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">problem by cutting back on waste in student loans, school<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">lunches, veterans benefits or veterans pensions?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. You could eliminate all those programs and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">you wouldn't solve this problem.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. You mentioned tax fairness. Can you make a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">statement how fair the abolition of the estate tax would be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">while this is going on?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Well, as you know, the estate tax is mainly<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">paid by just a handful of very large estates. Some of them were<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">listed in today's Washington Post, the Hallmark Card family and<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Mars Candy family, the ones who have been pushing hardest<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">for repeal of the tax. For 98\1/2\ percent of Americans there<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">is no estate tax. So it was one of our most progressive taxes<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and one that was an extraordinarily good deal for the vast<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">majority of Americans.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. When you talk about the foreign taxes, would you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cure that by changing the foreign taxes from a credit to a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">deduction?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Actually, no. I mean our goal on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">international is to try to tax companies on the money they make<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in the United States. We don't try to tax them on their<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">legitimate foreign profits. We do try to stop them from<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">artificially shifting profits offshore to avoid taxes on what<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they make here. So the foreign tax credit says, look, if you<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">pay tax to France or Germany we are not going to tax you again.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Fair enough. But if you shift your profits to Bermuda, we are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">not going to honor that, and shouldn't honor that. The chairman<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the Ways and Means Committee wants to honor it. If we crack<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down on the abuses and say we want to measure your profits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">fairly in the United States and that is what you pay tax on,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">just by getting rid of the offshore tax shelters, I am<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">confident could raise $50 billion a year.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Scott. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Chairman Nussle. Thank the gentleman.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. By your calculation what is the effective<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">corporate tax rate today?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Well, my calculation in 2002 was that it was<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about 15.4 percent. Since then, Congress has adopted even<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">larger corporate tax breaks. So I would think it is less than<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">15, probably in the ballpark of 12 or 13 percent right now,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">about a third of the statutory rate.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. How much of that is attributable to the ability<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of American multinational firms to move their earnings or<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">allocate their earnings overseas and outside the jurisdiction<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the United States?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Well, if corporations paid taxes on all of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">their U.S. profits at the 35 percent rate, they would be paying<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">more than double what they are paying now, something in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">order of about $280 billion. The recent tax legislation on<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">depreciation has cut that by about $50 billion a year. Offshore<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">sheltering cuts it by another 50. And then there are other<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">items in the tax code that cut it down the rest of the way. So<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of the total drop in the effective rate, well, a little more<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">than a sixth is due to offshore shelters.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Would you explain to us exactly how a company<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">declares that Bermuda is its headquarters and is now<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">domesticated in another country and most of its earnings accrue<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">and are allocated to that country rather than this one?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Well, I will tell you why they bother. We<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">have rules in the tax code that have been there since the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Kennedy administration that try with limited success, but some,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">to restrict a company's ability to use tax havens. But those<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">rules only apply to American companies. If a company, say Price<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Waterhouse Coopers Consulting, which was planning to do it last<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">summer, can reincorporate itself as a foreign corporation, say<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">in Bermuda, and then shift part of its operations to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Liechtenstein and some of it to Barbados on paper, our rules<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that stop them from doing that shift out of the United States<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">don't work very well. Bermuda was sort of an elegant way to get<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">around the rules that Congress set up to stop these kinds of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">abuses. Unfortunately, in the current Ways and Means Committee,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the chairman believes that these abuses are good.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Now in your testimony you indicate that<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Germany, United Kingdom and Japan have all taken steps to clamp<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">down on this tax avoidance scheme. Have they redefined what is<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a domestic corporation, what is a foreign corporation?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Basically their rule is that if you are owned<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">by Germans, you are a German company. We could do the same<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">thing here. If you are an American-owned company you are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">American, even if you happen to plant your flag on an atoll in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the Pacific or in Bermuda.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. You indicate one of the problems is allowing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">firms which haven't actually paid taxes to a foreign entity<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">which they can claim as a credit against U.S. income, but also<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they defer--even if they haven't paid the taxes but have<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">deferred them, they can treat the deferral as having paid<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">foreign taxes on income allocated to some other jurisdiction?</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. McIntyre. Deferral says that the companies doesn't pay<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">taxes on their foreign profits, foreign in quotes here, until<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they repatriate them, which is basically never. The problem<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">with deferral primarily is that it makes it too easy for<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">companies to shift their profits to tax havens. Deferral is not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">an issue if you are paying taxes in Europe to real countries,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">because the foreign tax credit would shelter your profits<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">anyway. So when John Kennedy proposed what became the anti-tax<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">haven rules, he actually proposed to get rid of deferral<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">entirely because it was the clean and elegant solution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Unfortunately, the Congress wouldn't go that far.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>Mr. Spratt. Is this definitionally hard to accomplish?</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">projects would have cost in the private sector. The unnecessary costs<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">found errors in 70 percent of the wage forms, frequent undetected<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Upon further investigation, it turns out the association representing<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">the vast majority of contractors in the area did not even receive the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">outdated union job categories, providing yet another inefficient<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Former Federal Reserve Board Governor Lawrence Lindsay commented,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">``These restrictions (to not allow helpers) impede inner city<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">they tend to deprive local residents of job opportunities.'' Not only<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">does the inflated cost in inner city development prevent the use of the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">local labor, it impacts the general public for whom the projects are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">designed. For example, the increased costs greatly decrease the benefit<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">of low-income housing. One study found the Act reduces the number of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">minority workers in the construction industry by 25,000 per year;<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">another study showed that in states with little Davis-Bacon laws<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">African American employment in construction is less than half that in<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">states without the law. With presently no allowance for helpers, a<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">business has one of two choices in filling unskilled labor positions. A<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">workers performing menial tasks or b) hiring unskilled labor which<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">means that workers with few to no skills will be paid the same wage as<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a ``veteran'' worker. This diminishes moral among higher skilled<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Veterans, Paralyzed Veterans of America, and Veterans of Foreign Wars,<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">we are writing to express our concern as you proceed to investigate<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">proposed additional ``savings'' from veterans' benefits and services<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">based on what is assumed to be waste, fraud and abuse within the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We were pleased that the Budget Committee abandoned its proposal to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">cut $28 billion in veterans' mandatory and discretionary spending over<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">a 10-year period in the fiscal year 2004 Concurrent Budget Resolution.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">However, we are concerned that this Committee is proceeding to require<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">committees such as the Committee on Veterans Affairs to report<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">arbitrarily established recommended mandatory spending cuts in the<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">amounts of $342 million in fiscal year 2004 and $3.9 billion over 10<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">years.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>We are certainly no friends of waste, fraud, or abuse. We believe<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">that any waste, fraud, and abuse should be identified as part of an<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">ongoing effort by the VA and remedied by the VA and the Committees of<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">jurisdiction. Because of the very nature of any such savings, we do not<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">believe that they can be identified as a rhetorical goal. We are<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">concerned that any such savings, identified in this forum, will not be<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">used to improve the provision of benefits and services to veterans. To<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">set a target that is arbitrary could very well mean that the mandated<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">target might very well not be met, and that real benefits will need to<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">be cut to reach such a goal. These would be real cuts affecting real<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">people, veterans, their families, and survivors.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>At a time when veterans are waiting months to receive earned health<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">respectively ask this Committee, as well as the VA and the Committees<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></span></p>
